# Background
Refresh site manually to see the added tasks. Not yet added useeffect for those due to currently missing good structure of the code.
One part is commented out in the code, the delete old tasks endpoint. It was working locally, but when deployed to Netlify with the Heroku link, it doesn't work anymore. Could it be that the code in the endpoint is possibly not interpreted the same in Heroku as it is locally? Is that even possible?

However, that is a problem as it remained a mystery and took long time of trial and error back and fourth for debugging to finding that that was the issue.
